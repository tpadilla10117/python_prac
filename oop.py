#Practicing OOP concepts:

#Practicing making an empty class:
class Empty:
  pass

class User:
  pass

#instantiating a new user from the User class:
user1 = User()
print(user1) #prints an empty user object with the address at <__main__.User object at 0x7f91b001bdc0>

user2 = User()
print(user2)

# E.g. Define a class called Vehicle.  It should be completely empty/. After the class is defined, create two instances of Vehicle.  Save one to a variable called car, and another to a variable called boat

class Vehicle:
  pass
car = Vehicle()
boat = Vehicle()
